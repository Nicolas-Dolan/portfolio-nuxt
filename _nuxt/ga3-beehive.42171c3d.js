It was designed to help creatives from different specialties connect and collaborate on projects. We all contributed to the initial idea and design of the website, using wireframes to visualise it. We built the front end using React and Bulma and the back end with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I was involved in all parts of the website but took ownership of much of the back end and the messaging system.
