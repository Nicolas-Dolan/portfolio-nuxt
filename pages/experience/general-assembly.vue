      During this full-time course, I immersed myself in the world of software
      engineering, exploring a wide range of technologies and development
      methodologies. Working solo and in teams, I produced four main projects
      and numerous side projects. The course focused on the MERN stack, but also
      covered Python with Django and best practices such as test-driven
      development and the Agile workflow.
