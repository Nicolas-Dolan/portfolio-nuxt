      Within the RESIDE group at ICL, I develop several open-source applications
      used in public health research. Typically, these applications contain
      statistical models used by ministries of health around the world to inform
      healthcare policy for diseases such as HIV, malaria, and COVID-19.

      I primarily develop the web interfaces for these applications,
      contributing modular, maintainable code to both the front and back end via
      continuous integration. I also ensure all code is fully covered by unit,
      integration, and Selenium tests throughout development. My team works in
      an Agile manner and I regularly give and receive code reviews.
