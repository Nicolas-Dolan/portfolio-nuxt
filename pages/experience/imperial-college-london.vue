      Within the RESIDE group at ICL, I developed several open-source
      applications used in public health research. Typically, these applications
      contained statistical models used by ministries of health around the world
      to inform healthcare policy for diseases such as HIV, malaria, and
      COVID-19.

      I primarily developed the web interfaces for these applications,
      contributing modular, maintainable code to both the front and back end via
      continuous integration. I also ensured all code is fully covered by unit,
      integration, and Selenium tests throughout development. My team worked in
      an Agile manner and I regularly gave and received code reviews.
