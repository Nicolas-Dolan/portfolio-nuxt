    <h3>BSc in Biomedical Science</h3>
    <h4>King’s College London (2008 - 2011)</h4>

      During this degree, I selected modules mainly related to neuroscience,
      pharmacology, and physiology. I enjoyed the opportunity to deep-dive into
      the intricacies of the human body and found that the more I learned, the
      more my curiosity grew. I’ve maintained this interest throughout my career
      and, although I am not exclusively looking for health-care-related
      opportunities, I am very interested in continuing to work in the
      medical/health sector as a developer.
