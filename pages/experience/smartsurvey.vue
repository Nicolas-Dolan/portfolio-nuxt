      >, I develop the section of the website concerned with analysing and
      graphically displaying survey results. I work in an Agile,
      cross-functional team, using the Scrum methodology.

      In addition to rolling out many new features, I have made an outsized
      impact on the quality of the code base—identifying and providing solutions
      to technical debt that have made subsequent development in those areas
      much faster and less error prone. I have also refactored a lot of legacy
      code, converting Vue 2 to Vue 3 and adding full TypeScript support.
      Finally, I have provided mentorship to other developers and championed
      best practices via pair coding, code reviews, and presentations.

      The main technologies used in the front end are Vue.js, TypeScript,
      Bootstrap, SCSS, Jest, and Vue Test Utils. I also contribute to the back
      end with C#, .NET, and PostgresSQL. We use a custom CMS and Azure DevOps.
