      Edited ‘fast-track’ primary research and review material in preparation
      for publication in the journal, checking scientific accuracy, use of
      English, clarity, readability, and application of house style.
    </p>
    <p>Managed multiple ongoing projects and met tight deadlines.</p>
    <p>
      Created Excel spreadsheets, which automated time-consuming routine copy
      editing tasks such as reformatting data tables. I then shared these
      spreadsheets with my colleagues, saving the company hundreds of hours in
      labour time.
