    <p>
      I worked in a team of four for a week to create this full-stack
      application. It was designed to help creatives from different specialties
      connect and collaborate on projects. We all contributed to the initial
      idea and design of the website, using wireframes to visualise it. We built
      the front end using React and Bulma and the back end with MongoDB,
      Express, and Node.js. I was involved in all parts of the website but took
      ownership of much of the back end and the messaging system. We used Agile
      methodology to distribute work, holding ‘scrums’ regularly and tracking
      our project on Trello.
