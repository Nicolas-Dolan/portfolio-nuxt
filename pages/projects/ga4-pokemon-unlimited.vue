    <h2>Project 4: Pokémon Unlimited</h2>
    <p>
      For my final project, I was allocated 1 week. I decided to work solo
      because I wanted to have a hand in every part of its development. Paying
      tribute to a franchise from my childhood, Pokémon, the project used a
      database to store user-created Pokémon that could then be implemented into
      a grid-based game. I wanted to create something that was both fun and
      complex, testing my abilities and drawing on everything I’d learned so
      far. I created the back-end database using a Python-based framework called
      Django and managed it with PostgreSQL. I then installed React, a
      JavaScript-based framework, for the front end and used Axios to make
      database requests.
